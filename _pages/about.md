Welcome! On this site I'll be sharing academic projects about ethics in computer science including blog posts, podcasts, and a case study. 

About Me
---
My name is Elise Hachfeld. Iâ€™m a student in the [Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department](https://wp.stolaf.edu/mscs/) at St. Olaf College. I'm earning my B.S in Bioinformatics with concentrations in Neuroscience and Statistics and Data Science.

Research 
---
I have been involved in several projects that integrate biology, computer science and data science on the St. Olaf campus. 
These include:
* Developing a image processing workflow for detecting lipid droplets in Tetrahymena thermophila cells
* Fine-tuning a convolutional neural network to classify images of lichen from iNaturalist
* Streamlining a simulation model on altruism in animal populations

Currently, I am working on methods of analyzing whole genome sequencing data. My research interests also include data privacy in human genomics and the impact of misinformation on social media.

Personal Life
---
Outside of academics, I love growing native Minnesota plants, researching Eastern European genealogy, watching movies, and spending time with my two cats.

Discussion Questions
---
### What is a data-driven rule, and what does it mean to be a data-driven exception? Is an exception the same as an error?


### In addition to those listed above, what other factors differentiate data-driven decisions from human ones?


### Beyond what is discussed above, what are some of the benefits and downsides of individualization?


### Why is uncertainty so critical to the right to be an exception? When the stakes are high (e.g., in criminal sentencing), is there any evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy) that can justify the use of a data-driven rule without the consideration of uncertainty?

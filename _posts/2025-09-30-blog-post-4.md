### Learning

### The Use of Creative Work for Training
I'm pretty torn on this issue. I hate that companies are sneaking clauses into their privacy policies allowing anything someone creates using their site to be the websites property. I think people should be compensated for their work being used as training data. However, I don't think the rise in image generation is going to eliminate the jobs of artists. I think people who buy art (myself included) understand that it is completely different than something AI generated. 

### Next-word Prediction
AI trained to predict the next word has a range of strange behaviors because the models are trained with an enormous amount of data, therefore they are able to pick up on patterns in the data. I guess I don't really understand the emergent abilities thing very well. My understanding from the article by Schaeffer et. al. is that they are abilities that show up in larger models but not smaller models, but they seem to argue in their paper that this might not actually be a real phenomenon? 

### Environmental Impact
The environmental impact of AI is one of the parts that I think I diverge from a lot of people because I think the concerns are a bit overblown. I DO think that there are some environmental concerns with AI, but the magnitude of its impact on the environment seems very small compared to a lot of other things like agriculture. I think a lot of people are focused on water usage when the resources used to make technology seems like a bigger issue to me. Think about how some people get a new iPhone every year and get rid of the old one. When my airpods break and I take them to the apple store there is no way to fix them. Modern technology is not made to be upgraded or fixed as much as it is made to be replaced.
